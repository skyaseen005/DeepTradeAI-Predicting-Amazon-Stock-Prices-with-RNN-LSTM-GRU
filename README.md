**Stock Price Prediction using RNN, LSTM, and GRU**

This project demonstrates how to predict the next-day closing price of a stock (AMZN by default) using deep learning models ‚Äî Simple RNN, LSTM, and GRU.
It downloads stock data via Yahoo Finance, trains three models, evaluates their performance, and compares them using error metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE).

üöÄ Features

Fetches real stock data using yfinance

Scales and sequences data for time series forecasting

Trains and evaluates three recurrent neural network models:

**SimpleRNN**

**LSTM**

**GRU**

Compares models using key metrics (MSE, RMSE, MAE)

Predicts next-day closing price

Visualizes model predictions vs actual prices

Identifies and prints the best performing model

Technologies Used

üìä Model Comparison Metrics
  Model        MSE      RMSE       MAE

Best Model Based on RMSE: GRU
Predicted Next Day Closing Price for AMZN using Best Model (GRU): $215.25

 Summary of All Model Predictions:
RNN: $218.28
LSTM: $214.55
GRU: $215.25

Insights

RNN: Fast but struggles with long-term dependencies.

LSTM: Best for handling sequential patterns in stock data.

GRU: Almost as good as LSTM, but lighter and faster.

Future Enhancements

Add multi-day forecasting

Integrate technical indicators (SMA, EMA, RSI)

Deploy using Streamlit or Flask

Implement hyperparameter tuning for optimal performance
